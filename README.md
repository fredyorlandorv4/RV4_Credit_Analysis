### Navigation Flow
```
📊 Overview → 🤖 Predictions → ⚠️ Withdrawal Risk → ✅ Completeness
```

## 🔧 Core Components

### 1. **Overview Dashboard**
- **KPI Cards**: Total applications, approval/rejection rates, processing times
- **Trend Analysis**: Time-series visualization of application volumes
- **Funnel Analysis**: Application lifecycle from submission to decision
- **Correlation Matrix**: Feature relationships and dependencies

### 2. **Prediction Engine**
```python
# Approval Prediction
success_probability = model.predict_proba(applicant_data)

# Withdrawal Risk Assessment
withdrawal_risk = predict_withdrawal_rule_based(behavioral_data)

# Document Completeness
completeness_score = (submitted_docs / required_docs) * 100
```

### 3. **Risk Assessment Models**
- **LightGBM Classifier**: Binary classification for loan approval
- **Rule-based Engine**: Behavioral pattern analysis for withdrawal prediction
- **Hybrid Scoring**: Combined ML and business rules approach

### 4. **Document Completeness System**

#### Weighted Scoring Algorithm
```python
# Critical Documents (60% weight)
critical_docs = ['doc_id', 'doc_salary', 'doc_bank_statement']
critical_weight = 0.6

# Supplementary Documents (40% weight)  
supplementary_docs = ['doc_tax_return', 'doc_property_docs']
supplementary_weight = 0.4

# Completeness Calculation
def calculate_completeness(submitted_docs, required_docs):
    critical_score = sum(1 for doc in critical_docs if doc in submitted_docs) / len(critical_docs)
    supplementary_score = sum(1 for doc in supplementary_docs if doc in submitted_docs) / len(supplementary_docs)
    
    total_score = (critical_score * critical_weight) + (supplementary_score * supplementary_weight)
    return round(total_score * 100, 1)
```

#### Status Classification
- **🔴 Incomplete (0-59%)**: Critical documents missing - Cannot proceed
- **🟡 Ready for Review (60-99%)**: Core documents present - Secondary review possible
- **🟢 Complete (100%)**: All documents verified - Ready for underwriting

#### Visual Indicators
- **Circular Progress Chart**: SVG-based dynamic completion visualization
- **Color-coded Status Badges**: Instant visual feedback on file status
- **Missing Document List**: Detailed breakdown of required items
- **Priority Flags**: High/Medium/Low urgency indicators for missing documents

## 📈 Machine Learning Pipeline

### Model Training Process
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Feature engineering and categorical encoding
2. **Model Selection**: LightGBM with cross-validation
3. **Performance Metrics**: Accuracy, AUC, Precision, Recall
4. **Model Persistence**: Automatic saving and loading of trained models
5. **Overfitting Protection**: Automatic detection and rule-based fallback

### Enhanced Prediction System
The system now includes intelligent overfitting detection and realistic prediction variability:

```python
# Overfitting Detection
if model_accuracy >= 0.99:  # 99%+ accuracy indicates overfitting
    use_rule_based_calculation()
    
# Realistic DTI Calculation
monthly_payment = calculate_mortgage_payment(loan_amount, interest_rate, duration)
dti_ratio = monthly_payment / monthly_income

# Market Variability
approval_score += market_conditions_factor  # ±10 points
approval_score += random_variation  # ±5 points for realism
```

### Smart Prediction Logic
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combines ML predictions with business rules
- **Market Factors**: Incorporates external market conditions
- **Edge Cases**: Handles realistic scenarios where rules don't apply perfectly
- **Confidence Scoring**: Provides confidence intervals for predictions

### Feature Engineering
```python
# Key Features for Approval Prediction
features = [
    'Credit_Score', 'Monthly_Income', 'DTI_Ratio', 'Age',
    'Employment_Status', 'Loan_Amount', 'Property_Price',
    'Down_Payment', 'Interest_Rate', 'Loan_Duration',
    'LTV_Ratio', 'Employment_Duration', 'Processing_Time'
]

# Enhanced Financial Calculations
def calculate_realistic_dti(loan_details, borrower_income):
    monthly_payment = mortgage_formula(loan_details)
    return monthly_payment / borrower_income

def determine_interest_rate(credit_score, loan_term, market_base=7.5):
    rate = market_base
    if credit_score >= 750: rate -= 1.0
    elif credit_score >= 700: rate -= 0.5
    elif credit_score < 600: rate += 1.0
    return rate + random_variation()
```
